<h1>QuickCMS Documentation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>QuickCMS is a Rails application that will help people new to Ruby on Rails to quickly develop simple database-enabled applications.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Simple Content Management System (modified basic scaffold using sqlite3)</li>
	<li>RedCloth integration for the CMS to hide HTML from your clients</li>
	<li>Simple HTTP Authentication (uses a hardcoded password in the pages controller)</li>
	<li>AJAX & HTML responsive buttons in the header (with mouseover effect)</li>
	<li>Simple Javascript slideshow</li>
	<li>Ability to set specific image(s) in the slideshow area, for any content page</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Load QuickCMS in your text editor</li>
	<li>Delete this file (quickcms/public/index.html)</li>
	<li>Uncomment the code in the "pages" scaffold view, index.html.erb</li>
	<li>Modify the HTTP authentication user/pass in the pages controller</li>
	<li>Run script/server and point browser to localhost:3000/admin (admin/pass)</li>
	<li>Add new pages to your database and/or modify existing ones, edit appropriate files to make them work</li>
	<li>Modify/create images in the quickcms/public/images/ directory</li>
	<li>Learn the rest by reading the comments and looking at code</li>
</ol>

<p>If you find QuickCMS useful, think about how to make it better and contribute to the project. For example, a hardcoded user/pass is pretty bad :)</p>
